# CS_230_TheGamingRoom

The Gaming Room client has asked us to develop a web-based application for their game,
Draw It or Lose It!, which has already been developed for Android OS.

They needed to have multiple users able to access their instance of a game. Multiple teams and users
had to access their unique game instance with multiple games being played at any given time.

We decided on a traditional client-server architecture and used Java for development.

I made clear the clients' needs, and did my best in explaining the differences between which server-side OS
would best fit those needs.

While going through the design document, it gave me a better understanding of why we used REST endpoints
and how those connected to the overall architecture of the application.

I need to revise the OS client-side part of the design document - providing a clear understanding
of why I chose Windows or Linux over Mac OS should be clear to the client.

If we don't consider the client's and users' needs, we are designing and developing software that is just for us...
We need to make sure the software that's being designed is what the client wants and what the user
ultimately needs as well.

Overall, this changed how I think about software design - it isn't code first, ask later. You need to be clear on
what is being developed, why, how it needs to work, and who is going to be using this.
It changed my perspective on how applications are developed, and I will use these lessons to further my
software design knowledge.
